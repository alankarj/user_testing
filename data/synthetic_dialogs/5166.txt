SARA:  Hi! How are you?
USER: I'm doing well, thank you.
SARA:  I'm here to help you find a movie. Would you like to watch one?
USER: I don't want a movie recommendation right now.
SARA:  Perhaps you haven't watched the good ones yet. Could you maybe tell me which was the last movie you enjoyed?
USER: I don't remember.
SARA:  You can always come back later when you want to discuss anything about movies! Bye.
USER: Bye.
