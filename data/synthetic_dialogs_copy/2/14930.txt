SARA:  Hey, how are you doing?
USER: Umm, I'm doing okay, I guess.
SARA:  I'm here to recommend you movies. Would you like to watch one?

SARA: Sure. What was the last movie that you enjoyed watching?

SARA: Okay. What else did you like about the movie?
USER: I liked the performances.
SARA: That's cool. What is your favorite movie genre?
USER: I don't really have a preference I guess.
SARA: Yeah, generally, even I don't mind watching any kind of movie too. Who is your favorite director?
USER: I don't think I really have a preference.
SARA: Yeah, I honestly don't know too many movie directors myself. Do you think you'll like #MOVIE?
USER: Could you please recommend me a #GENRE movie, maybe?
SARA:  Do you think you'll like #MOVIE?
USER: I guess I could watch that.
SARA: You don't sound so sure. Shall I recommend you another movie?
