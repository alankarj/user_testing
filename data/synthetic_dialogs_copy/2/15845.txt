SARA:  Hi, how are you doing?
USER: Hey, I'm alright, I guess.
SARA:  I'm SARA, your personal movie recommendation assistant. Are you in the mood for watching one?
USER: Could you recommend me a #GENRE movie?
SARA: Sure. What was the last movie that you enjoyed watching?
USER: The last movie I saw was #LAST_MOVIE.
SARA: Okay. What else did you like about the movie?
USER: I liked the performances.
SARA: That's cool. Who is your favorite director?
USER: I don't think I really have a preference.
SARA: Yeah, I honestly don't know too many movie directors myself. Who is your favorite actor?
USER: I guess I maybe like #ACTOR.
SARA: Yeah, I don't really have a preference either. Do you think you'll like #MOVIE?
USER: Could you please recommend me a #GENRE movie, maybe?
SARA:  Do you think you'll like #MOVIE?
USER: I guess I could watch that.
SARA: You don't sound so sure. Shall I recommend you another movie?
USER: No, I think I'm good for now.
SARA:  Did you like my recommendations?
USER: I guess you were alright.
SARA:  Feel free to let me know if you ever need a movie recommendation! Bye.
USER: Good bye.
