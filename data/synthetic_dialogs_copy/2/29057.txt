SARA:  Hi! How are you?
USER: I'm alright, I guess.
SARA:  I'm here to help you find a movie. Would you like to watch one?
USER: I really love watching movies too, especially with my family and friends.
SARA: Oh cool. What was the last movie that you enjoyed watching?
USER: The last movie I saw was #LAST_MOVIE.
SARA: Okay. What else did you like about the movie?
USER: I liked the performances.
SARA: That's cool. What is your favorite movie genre?
USER: I don't really have a preference I guess.
SARA: Yeah, generally, even I don't mind watching any kind of movie too. Who is your favorite director?
USER: I guess it's #DIRECTOR.
SARA: Yeah, I honestly don't know too many movie directors myself. Who is your favorite actor?
USER: I guess I don't really have a preference.
SARA: Yeah, I don't really have a preference either. Do you think you'll like #MOVIE?
USER: I've actually already seen that movie, and I don't really want to watch it again.
SARA:  I could recommend you a different movie if you'd like?
USER: No, I think I'm good for now.
SARA:  Did you like my recommendations?
USER: I guess you were alright.
SARA:  Feel free to let me know if you ever need a movie recommendation! Bye.
USER: Good bye.
