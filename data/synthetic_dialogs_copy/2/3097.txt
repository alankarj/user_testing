SARA:  Hi. How are you?
USER: Hi, I guess I'm doing alright.
SARA:  Can I help you find a movie to see?

SARA: Sure. What was the last movie that you enjoyed watching?
USER: The last movie I saw was #LAST_MOVIE.
SARA: Okay. What else did you like about the movie?
USER: I liked the performances.
SARA: That's cool. Who is your favorite director?
USER: I don't think I really have a preference.
SARA: Yeah, I honestly don't know too many movie directors myself. Who is your favorite actor?
USER: I guess I don't really have a preference.
SARA: Yeah, I don't really have a preference either. Do you think you'll like #MOVIE?
USER: Could you please recommend me a #GENRE movie, maybe?
SARA:  Do you think you'll like #MOVIE?
USER: I don't think I would like that movie.
SARA: You don't sound so sure. Shall I recommend you another movie?
