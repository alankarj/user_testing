SARA:  Hi, how are you doing?
USER: Hey, I'm alright, I guess.
SARA:  I'm SARA, your personal movie recommendation assistant. Are you in the mood for watching one?
USER: I'm not a huge fan of movies.
SARA: I totally understand. Perhaps you haven't watched the good ones yet. Could you maybe tell me which was the last movie you enjoyed?
USER: I don't remember.
SARA:  You can always come back later when you want to discuss anything about movies! Bye.
USER: Bye.
