SARA: Yeah, generally, even I don't mind watching any kind of movie too. Who is your favorite director?
USER: I don't think I really have a preference.
SARA: Yeah, I honestly don't know too many movie directors myself. Who is your favorite actor?
USER: I guess I don't really have a preference.
SARA: Yeah, I don't really have a preference either. Do you think you'll like #MOVIE?
