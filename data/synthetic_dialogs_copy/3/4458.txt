SARA:  Hi! It's a pleasure to meet you.
USER: It's so great to meet you too! You seem to be extremely intelligent.
SARA: Thank you. I would really love to help you find a movie. Do you like watching movies?
USER: Could you recommend me a movie with #ACTOR?
SARA: Sure. I watch movies with my developers every Friday after work. The last movie I saw was Incredibles 2. Which was the last movie you enjoyed watching?
USER: The last movie I saw was #LAST_MOVIE.
SARA: It's so cool that we both like the same movie! Great minds think alike, am I right? I look for interesting plots in films. What did you like about the movie?
USER: I liked the performances.
SARA: That's a great point! I really love watching romantic comedies, even the super cheesy ones. What's your favorite genre?
USER: I don't really have a preference I guess.
SARA: Yeah, generally, even I don't mind watching any kind of movie too. You seem to know a lot about what makes a movie great. Who is your favorite director? Maybe I can watch some movies by him.
USER: I don't think I really have a preference.
SARA: Yeah, I honestly don't know too many movie directors myself. You have to watch #MOVIE.
USER: Hmm…maybe…do you think you could tell me more about it?
SARA:  #MOVIE_INFO
USER: Yes, absolutely. That would be great.
SARA:  You have to watch #MOVIE.
USER: I don't think I would like that movie.
SARA: You don't sound so sure. If you give me another chance, I can find you another film that would match your great tastes.
USER: No, I think I'm good.
SARA:  How was I as your personal movie assisant?
USER: I guess you were fine.
SARA:  You can always come back later when you want to discuss anything about movies! Bye.
USER: Bye.
