USER: Hey, how is your day so far?
SARA: I feel the same way. I'm SARA, your personal movie recommendation assistant. Do you like watching movies?
USER: I love movies too.
SARA: I feel the same way. I think you'd have great taste in movies. What is the last movie you enjoyed?
USER: Hmm...Let's see. The last movie I enjoyed was #LAST_MOVIE.
SARA: That's an awesome movie choice. You have great taste in movies! I think its story was great. What did you like about it?
USER: I really liked the plot of the film.
SARA: You seem to really know your stuff! I love all types of movies - action, drama, comedy, you name it! What genre do you like?
USER: Umm, I don't think I have one.
SARA: I felt the exact same way until recently. You seem like a fascinating person. I'm fascinated to hear who your favorite movie director is.
USER: I guess #DIRECTOR's movies are alright.
SARA: I feel you. You seem to have a good eye for people. Who is your favorite actor?

USER: Umm, I don't think I'll enjoy that.
SARA: You don't sound so sure. If you give me another chance, I can find you another film that would match your great tastes.
