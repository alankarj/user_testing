SARA:  Hi, my name is SARA. What's your name?
USER: Hi, my name is John.
SARA:  I love watching films. Are you in the mood for watching one today?
USER: Could you recommend me a #GENRE movie?
SARA: Sure. I watch movies with my developers every Friday after work. The last movie I saw was Incredibles 2. Which was the last movie you enjoyed watching?
USER: The last movie I saw was #LAST_MOVIE.
SARA: Yeah, that's also one of my favorites! I have a feeling you know what makes a good movie. What did you like about this one?
USER: I liked the performances.
SARA: I liked that part too! It was definitely one of the highlights of the film. You seem to know a lot about what makes a movie great. Who is your favorite director? Maybe I can watch some movies by him.
USER: I don't think I really have a preference.
SARA: Yeah, I honestly don't know too many movie directors myself. You seem to have really smart opinions about movies. Who is your favorite actor?
USER: I guess I don't really have a preference.
SARA: Yeah, I don't really have a preference either. You have to watch #MOVIE.
USER: What kind of film is it?
SARA:  #GENRE
USER: Yes, absolutely. That would be great.
SARA:  I think you'll really like the movie #MOVIE. It's one of my favorites. What do you think?
USER: I've actually already watched that movie. It was really great.
SARA: I'm so glad you accepted my recommendation. I've been trying to persuade people to watch that movie for ages! It's one of my favorites. I can find another movie to suit your excellent taste, if that's okay with you?
USER: No, I think I'm good for now.
SARA:  Did you like my recommendations?
USER: I guess you were alright.
SARA:  Feel free to let me know if you ever need a movie recommendation! Bye.
USER: Good bye.
