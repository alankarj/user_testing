SARA: Cool, I was pretty impressed with the acting. I'm enjoying talking about movies with you. What's your favorite genre?
USER: I guess I don't really have a preference.
SARA: Okay, I have trouble picking a favorite because I like all kinds of movies! You're really cool. Who's your favorite director?
USER: I don't think I really know any directors.
SARA: Alright. I like so many that I can't pick a favorite. You have such good taste. Who is your favorite actor?
USER: I guess I don't have a preference.
SARA: There are so many actors out there, it's hard for me to pick a favorite. You've been helpful in all of your input. I think you'd like #MOVIE.
